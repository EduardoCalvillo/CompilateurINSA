# CompilateurINSA
### Overview
### How to run the code
1. Download the git repository.
2. Open a terminal and execute the following command: _make simple_ or _make test_, if you want to use simple.c or test.c respectively.

### Modifying the input code
To parse your own code, modify simple.c or test.c instead of making a new file to keep the Makefile working.

### Executing the interpretator
Once you have compiled your .c file successfully and asmFile.asm has been generated, you can execute the python interpreter with the following command in a terminal: _python interpreter.py asmFile.asm_.
